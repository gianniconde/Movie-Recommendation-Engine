## About the Project
The goal of this project is to examine IMDB movie text data to develop a movie recommendation model based on genre and description. The methods used for this analysis are supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The supervised machine learning algorithms include multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and support vector machine (SVM). The unsupervised machine learning algorithms include K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). <br>
